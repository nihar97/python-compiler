# Top-level Makefile for Project 1.
# 
# Targets:
#   make [ default ]        Compiles sources in src directory
#   make check              Compiles sources and runs tests.  The parameter
#                            APYC indicates which compiler to run.
#   make clean              Removes unnecessary files, including those that
#                            are reproducible.
#   make depend	     Compute makefile dependencies and store
#                            in .depend.  Use this whenever you add a new
#                            source file or change an #include line.
#   make really-clean       Same as 'clean', also removes the file .depend.
